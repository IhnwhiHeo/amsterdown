`amsterdown` is an RMarkdown PhD thesis template for the University of Amsterdam. It's based on [my PhD thesis](https://github.com/lcreteig/thesis) that I wrote with [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). I figured I'd make a more basic and more general template in case anyone else at the UvA wants to do the same.

This repo is currently just a skeleton and the package is not functional yet.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lcreteig/amsterdown")
```
## Building the thesis

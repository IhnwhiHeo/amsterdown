```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


The best way to figure out how the template works is to look at [the source files](https://github.com/lcreteig/amsterdown/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/thesis/skeleton) and output together, to understand how one is created from the other. Other than how to create headings, italic text and the like, I've included basic examples of things iyou're likely to need whilst writing a thesis, such as citations, tables, plots, and equations.

Or, check out the source files for [my PhD thesis](https://github.com/lcreteig/thesis), or any other PhD thesis templates (e.g. [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown), [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown), or [oxforddown](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown)).

For more extensive documentation, please see these other excellent sources on Markdown syntax, R Markdown, and `bookdown`:

* Almost everything you'll need to know can be found in the [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
* For a quick (R) Markdown reference, check out [RStudio's R Markdown cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).
* R Markdown uses pandoc-flavored Markdown, the complete reference for which is [pandoc's  documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).
* The integration of R code is handled by the [knitr package](https://yihui.name/knitr/). Code chunks can be customized with many options  that determine how the ouput is displayed (e.g., whether the code is included; if a plot is generated, what it's size should be, etc.). Check out a complete overview of these options [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/).

## Drafting the template

### Using the RStudio interface

If you're using RStudio (and you've installed the package):

1. Go to "File" in the menu bar, then choose "New File" > "R Markdown...". 
2. In the following screen (see the screenshot below), click "From Template" in the bar on the left. Then select "UvA thesis" {amsterdown}.
3. Choose any folder on your computer to store the files (under "Location"). However, make sure to name this directory `index` (under "Name"). This is only to ensure that the main file will be correctly named `index.Rmd`; after the template has been created, feel free to change the name of the directory.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/newrmarkdown.png")
```

### From the console

You can also use the `rmarkdown::draft()` function to do all of the above:

```{r eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft('index.Rmd', # create new draft based off template
                 template = 'thesis', package = 'amsterdown', 
                 create_dir = TRUE, edit = FALSE) 
```

Again, this will also create a directory named `index`, but feel free to change that name.

## The template files

Your newly created folder with the thesis template should contain the following files.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#fs::dir_tree(here::here("inst/rmarkdown/templates/thesis/skeleton"))
```
```
├── 01-introduction.Rmd
├── 02-chapter.Rmd
├── 03-chapter.Rmd
├── 04-discussion.Rmd
├── 05-supplement.Rmd
├── 06-references.Rmd
├── 07-summary-Dutch.Rmd
├── 08-acknowledgments.Rmd
├── 09-miscellaneous.Rmd
├── _00-preface.Rmd
├── _bookdown.yml
├── figures
│   ├── uvalogo_regular_p_en.jpg
│   └── uvalogo_regular_p_en.pdf
├── index.Rmd
├── template.tex
└── thesis.bib
```

* The `.Rmd` (R Markdown) files each contain a single chapter. The easiest way to keep them in order is by prefixing a number to the file name: this ordering will also determine the order of the chapters in the book. However, this doesn't hold for two of these:
    * `index.Rmd` does not actually contain any R Markdown content, but only YAML options that determine how the book will be rendered. See the [YAML variables](#yaml-variables) section below. The name of this file must be `index.Rmd`, as it will become the "home page" of the HTML version of the thesis (which is only recognized if it is named `index.html`)
    * `_00-preface.Rmd` will only show in the HTML version of the thesis; it is intended to house some of the info that's in the front matter of the PDF version of the book (e.g. funding info, names of your supervisers, etc.). It does not follow the regular ordering scheme: this will always come first, because it is referred to directly in `index.Rmd`. If you don't want something like this, simply remove the code chunk in `index.Rmd` that references it.
* `_bookdown.yml` contains a few more YAML options. See the [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) for more info, though you likely won't ever have to change any of these.
* the `/figures` folder contains some example images included in the template (the UvA logo).
* `template.tex` is the pandoc LaTeX template that will determine how the PDF output of the thesis will look. If you ever want to change something about the PDF (e.g., the font that's used, where the page numbers are, etc.), you'll likely have to modify this file and add some latex commands.
* `thesis.bib` is a BibTeX file that contains all the bibliographic information on the cited works in your thesis. Most reference managers (e.g. Mendeley; Zotero) can export such a file based on your library of references. You can change the name or location of this file, as long as you change the `bibliography` field in `index.Rmd` as well.

## Building the thesis

To render the PDFs, you'll also need pandoc and a LaTeX distribution

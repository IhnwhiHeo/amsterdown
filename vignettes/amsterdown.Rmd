```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


The best way to figure out how the template works is to look at [the source files](https://github.com/lcreteig/amsterdown/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/thesis/skeleton) and output together, to understand how one is created from the other. Other than how to create headings, italic text and the like, I've included basic examples of things iyou're likely to need whilst writing a thesis, such as citations, tables, plots, and equations.

Or, check out the source files for [my PhD thesis](https://github.com/lcreteig/thesis), or any other PhD thesis templates (e.g. [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown), [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown), or [oxforddown](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown)).

For more extensive documentation, please see these other excellent sources on Markdown syntax, R Markdown, and `bookdown`:

* Almost everything you'll need to know can be found in the [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
* For a quick (R) Markdown reference, check out [RStudio's R Markdown cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).
* R Markdown uses pandoc-flavored Markdown, the complete reference for which is [pandoc's  documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).
* The integration of R code is handled by the [knitr package](https://yihui.name/knitr/). Code chunks can be customized with many options  that determine how the ouput is displayed (e.g., whether the code is included; if a plot is generated, what it's size should be, etc.). Check out a complete overview of these options [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/).

## Drafting the template

### Using the RStudio interface

If you're using RStudio (and you've installed the package):

1. Go to "File" in the menu bar, then choose "New File" > "R Markdown...". 
2. In the following screen (see the screenshot below), click "From Template" in the bar on the left. Then select "UvA thesis" {amsterdown}.
3. Choose any folder on your computer to store the files (under "Location"). However, make sure to name this directory `index` (under "Name"). This is only to ensure that the main file will be correctly named `index.Rmd`; after the template has been created, feel free to change the name of the directory.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/newrmarkdown.png")
```

### From the console

You can also use the `rmarkdown::draft()` function to do all of the above:

```{r eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft('index.Rmd', # create new draft based off template
                 template = 'thesis', package = 'amsterdown', 
                 create_dir = TRUE, edit = FALSE) 
```

Again, this will also create a directory named `index`, but feel free to change that name.

## The template files

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#fs::dir_tree(here::here("inst/rmarkdown/templates/thesis/skeleton"))

## Building the thesis

To render the PDFs, you'll also need pandoc and a LaTeX distribution

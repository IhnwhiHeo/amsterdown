knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Here's a list of a few extra issues you might run into while writing your thesis, and some potential solutions. Most of this is based on my own experience, so your mileage may vary. If I hear of any additional bottlenecks I'd be happy to include them.

## Microsoft Word

While writing the thesis, you might want to output it to a `.docx` file, say if your supervisors prefer to work with Microsoft Word instead. This is possible, although not all `bookdown` / RMarkdown features are supported. It will get you most of the way there, but you might have to edit the Word file a bit, or inform your supervisors that this is not exactly what the final version will look like.

To render the whole thesis to one Word file, run the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::word_document2")
```

You can also render a single chapter (e.g. if you want to send it out for feedback):

```{r eval=FALSE}
# render chapter 2 to Word
bookdown::preview_chapter("02-chapter.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::word_document2")
```

In both cases, you should now find a `thesis.docx` file in the output folder (`/_book/`) by default.

## Switching languages

Some sections of the thesis will have to be in Dutch (i.e., the Dutch summary). In others (e.g., the acknowledgments), you might want to use another language of your choice. To make sure things like hyphenation will work properly, you should not just start typing in a different language, but encase all non-English text within special language tags. 

Here's how you do it:

```
This paragraph uses the default language (English).

::: {lang=nl}
> Deze paragraaf is in het Nederlands.
:::

This sentence is in English. ['Dieser Satz ist auf Deutsch.']{lang=de} And now back to English.
```

Also see [this entry in `pandoc`'s documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#language-variables) and the examples in the template's Dutch Summary and Acknowledgments chapters. 

## Figures and images

To render image/figure files, I'd recommend `knitr::include_graphics()`.

This allows you to include both bitmap and vector versions of the same figure. Most commonly this would be, a `.png` (bitmap) version of the figure for `html` output, and a `.pdf` (vector) figure for the `pdf` version of the thesis. The `auto_pdf` option will insert the figure in vector format for pdf output automatically, or use the specified figure otherwise (in bitmap). For example:

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/my_figure.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Tables

Simpler tables can be inserted in [Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables), or created from R data frames using the `knitr::kable()` function. More complex tables (with row/column-spanners, formatting inside the table, etc.) can be created with R packages such as [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) (for [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/)) or [kableExtra](http://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) (for pretty much anything you might want).

## Citation styles

Citations are handled by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) (using the `citeproc` extension) by default. The [citation style](https://citationstyles.org/) (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago, but also according to specific journals) can be customized by downloading the corresponding `.csl` file from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). For example, to use APA style (through `apa.csl`, placed in the root directory of your thesis), add the following YAML line to `index.Rmd`, underneath whatever output you want to use the style for (`bookdown::pdf_book()` or `bookdown::gitbook()`):

```{yaml}
# N.B. the template already contains this line, but it is commented out
pandoc_args: [ "--csl", "apa.csl" ]
```

If you want to customize the output further, you could consider using a LaTeX package, such as [biblatex](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en) instead of `pandoc-citeproc` (Also see [my PhD thesis](https://github.com/lcreteig/thesis), which used `biblatex`). This will offer you much more flexibility, at the expense of complexity, and it will only work for pdf outputs. To do that, add the following line (indented under `bookdown::pdf_book()`) to `index.Rmd` instead:

```yaml
output:
  bookdown::pdf_book:
    citation_package: biblatex
```

* Using Python
* `knitr::is_html_output()` & `knitr::is_latex_output()`
* float positions
* inline code
* `\chaptermark{}` for long headers

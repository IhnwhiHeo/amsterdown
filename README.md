`amsterdown` is an RMarkdown PhD thesis template for the University of
Amsterdam. It’s based on [my PhD
thesis](https://github.com/lcreteig/thesis) that I wrote with
[`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). I figured I’d make a
more basic and more general template in case anyone else at the UvA
wants to do the same.

The template supports `html` and `pdf` outputs. To inspect the outputs
as produced by the latest version of the template, see here:
[html](https://lcreteig.github.io/amsterdown),
[pdf](https://lcreteig.github.io/amsterdown/thesis.pdf).

## Installation

Get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lcreteig/amsterdown")
```

## Building the thesis

This package is currently under active development; there’s not a lot of
functionality yet. To be continued…
